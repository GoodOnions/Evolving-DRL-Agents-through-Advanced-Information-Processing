## Abstract
This study examines the impact of input preprocessing techniques on the learning efficiency of
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents, with a specific focus on addressing the research question:
”How does the agent’s performance change when the environment is presented using a more dense
representation (i.e., more information encoded in the same space or the same amount of information
encoded in a smaller space)?” The research centers on integrating advanced image processing and
dimensionality reduction strategies to enhance RL algorithm performance.

Utilizing the OpenAI Gym framework and the Super Mario video game environment, the study
assesses the effectiveness of increasing information density provided to the agent, achieved through both
the utilization of more data and the reduction of the input representation space. Key techniques explored
encompass semantic segmentation with U-Net and its representation layers, as well as the development
and application of a frame merging technique. 

While neither method conclusively demonstrated an
improvement in the agent’s performance, frame merging, which introduces the state-transition concept
into the input representation, showcased a more stable enhancement in the agent’s capabilities.
